description: A low-cost arduino solution to diagnosing common learning disabilities in remote locations.

For Code Overflow(2022) we built a hardware hack that uses arduinos and basic components to solve a real problem to education. In countries that have a lack of childhood care, learning disabilites can be a major issue. We fix this by creating a simple tool, that requires no internet, and no extra equipment, to test for common learning disabilites, at a price that is accessible to many people who have an urge to help those in developing and developed countries.
