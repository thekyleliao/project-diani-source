## Who We Are

We are HS students from Brooklyn Tech, Goldstein, and Edison and all joined this hackathon for different reasons but came to a common conclusion. We wanted to make something impactful. Consequently, we decided using arduinos was not only original but far within the skillset of our lead dev, Sahib.
