## How to use It?
The current mode we have developed is only for Dyslexia detection. You will turn it on using power button on the arduino nano, the small blue board, then you will press the buttons in the sequence that the lights illuminate. If you are successful, then you will get all lights flashing red. Otherwise, you will only get one light flashing. This is to see if you have the memory patter skills that someone without dyslexia would have. The best thing is it doesn't require internet, just power!
